              MagicRedact processes documents in two ways:
              <br />
              1. <strong>Manual Processing (Local)</strong>: All redaction happens in your
              browserâ€”nothing is uploaded.
              <br />
              2. <strong>Auto-Redaction (Server-Based)</strong>: Documents are securely uploaded,
              processed, and then permanently deleted.
            </Text>
            <Text mt="sm" fw={500}>
              Please note: MagicRedact is not HIPAA compliant.
